        <h2>First, the basics.</h2>
        <p>You need the following to build your website.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>HTML and CSS</li>
            <li>Javascript</li>
            <li>Node.js</li>

        <h2>Let's try Some Inline Elements</h2>

        <p>Sometimes you want to <em>draw attention to something</em> in a line of text. <br/>
        
        Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize something</strong> in the text. <br/>
        Sometimes you want to <strong><em>do both</em></strong>.

    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings.</p>
    <!-- Content goes here -->

    <h2>Lists</h>
      <p>This how you make an unordered list:</p>

      <ul> <!-- only contains <li> elements so you would need to wrap in <li>-->
          <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
          <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
          <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
        <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
        <li>You should be noticing things is this precise order, because this is an ordered list</li>
      </ol>

    <h2>Inline Elements</h2>

    <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.<p>

    <p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance of a word or phrase.</p>

    <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>

    <h2>Empty Elements</h2>

    <p>Thanks for reading! Interneting should be getting easier now.</p>

    <p>Regards,<br/>
